# Input identity and execution receipts

`commands.py run --input PATH` explicitly registers files or directories to preserve. DesignCraft --source and LightCraft --import inputs are also registered. Missing inputs, symlinks and special entries are rejected. Directories are limited to 100000 entries. Paths hidden inside native parameters are not automatically registered; this is evidence capture, not a filesystem sandbox.

The gateway captures plan, explicit input, runtime-lock and skill-resource identities before live catalog discovery, and rechecks inputs/resources before edits. STARTED receipts use same-directory staging, file fsync and atomic replacement. A single native session executes the plan. The launcher writes a versioned JSON result file separate from native stdout/stderr; the gateway checks its schema and consistency with the child exit status before preserving partial logs and post-execution identities.

NATIVE_EXIT_ZERO_REVIEW_REQUIRED still requires actual artifact, project-reopen and creative checks. FAILED_OR_PARTIAL may have side effects. UNKNOWN preserves ambiguity and forbids automatic replay. Confirmed prelaunch failures are recorded as NOT_STARTED. Input or skill changes after zero exit require review and return failure. Post-execution checks do not roll back writes or prove all descendant processes stopped. Unknown-worker takeover, distributed leases and full transaction recovery remain open.

`scripts/sync_local_snapshot.py` updates only a matching unpublished local plugin after verifying old snapshot hashes. Modified user snapshots, published source identities and source removals are rejected. It does not establish a release, install tools, initialize Git or adopt a specification system.

Controlled subprocess tests verify status propagation and preservation. Actual native observations are saved separately, including the local Harness four-page create/save/PDF flow. Pinned-plugin discovery and nine read-only model routes pass for the recorded bundled Codex CLI and model; full native host workflows, restart recovery and creative acceptance remain open. See project-status.json and evidence/native/ for their separate scope.

## Native parameter schema boundary

PrintCraft checks the entire schema definition before validating a parameter value. Unsupported constraints in unselected combinator branches, absent optional properties, items and additionalProperties are refused; invalid definitions cannot be swallowed as branch mismatches. Boolean schemas are supported; enum/const compare JSON numbers by value while keeping booleans distinct. Patterns use Python semantics; this is not a complete JSON Schema validator.

The JSON reader rejects explicit NaN/Infinity and exponent overflow such as 1e10000, including native-only LightCraft/DesignCraft plans. Their textual parameter guidance remains native-only; successful structural checks do not establish native execution or state validity.


Use `commands.py receipt PATH` for offline read-only inspection. Legacy records are labeled `LEGACY_READ_ONLY`, remain ineligible for resume and replay, and retain available partial logs. Unknown future schemas are rejected. Receipt inspection neither installs a runtime nor invokes the native CLI.
